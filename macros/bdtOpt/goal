During our lunch meeting last week Kevin and Anapaola suggested that you could
also work on the optimization of the BDT cut, since you are already working on
optimizing the rest of the selection.
This is tricky because we want good performance looking at the rejection rate
but also need to keep enough statistics for the background fit... so there is
no clear figure of merit. We were thinking that perhaps something like the half
width of the peak of the Z' peak in the mT distribution, in relation to its
height from respect to the continuous background.... basically something that
takes into account the resolution of the resulting peak in the signal, but
leaves enough stats in the falling background...

Keep stats for background fit
